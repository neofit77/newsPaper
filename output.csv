"It was greeted with cautious optimism from hardliners within his own Conservative party, whose support will be crucial. But many European officials have dismissed Johnson's proposals as a non-starter.

With just over three weeks to go until the latest Brexit deadline of October 31, time is running out for Britain and the EU to negotiate a new agreement. The next summit of EU leaders is on October 17 and 18, and if anything is to be rubber-stamped at that meeting, the details will need to be nailed down well in advance.

If the PM doesn't get a deal by October 19, he is obliged by law to seek a new extension to the Brexit process. But Johnson has long maintained that he would take the UK out of the European Union on October 31 ""do or die.""

More than three years after the UK voted to leave the EU, and six months after it was first due to leave, a reckoning is fast approaching. Here are three ways the next three weeks could pan out.

Can Johnson get a deal?

The Prime Minister's new offer to Brussels centers on changes to the controversial ""Irish backstop"" -- the section of the previously negotiated Withdrawal Agreement that aims to prevent the return of border posts on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. That's been a red line for the EU since Brexit negotiations began.

Johnson concedes that under his new plan, some customs checks will be needed after Brexit, but suggested these can be done on a ""decentralized basis.""

The plan has received a cool reaction from the European side, but at least they now have something to talk about. The trouble is, it's hard to see the talks going far.

Officials in Dublin have said the proposals are incompatible with the promise to avoid any border on the island of Ireland, expressing concerns it would threaten the integrity of the European single market, and the peace that has pertained since the Good Friday Agreement that ended years of sectarian conflict in the region.

The European Parliament, which has a veto on any Brexit deal as it needs to ratify the treaty, is also unimpressed. The Parliament's Brexit Steering Group issued a statement Thursday saying the UK proposals ""do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise.""

Brigid Fowler, a senior researcher at the Hansard Society, says it seems unlikely -- but not impossible -- that the UK and EU will have enough time to reach an agreement, given these stark differences. ""The actual mechanics of getting that treaty ratified and enforced in time for 11 p.m. on 31st of October are extremely challenging -- even putting aside the politics,"" Fowler said.

While all this makes it seem highly unlikely that the British PM will be able to secure a departure deal with the EU in the coming days, the potential chaos of a no-deal Brexit may force last-minute compromises on both sides.

But there is still skepticism that Johnson could get a deal based on his plan passed through the UK Parliament, especially if he is forced to make concessions to placate the EU.

To be sure of a majority in Parliament, the government would need to bring booted rebel Conservative MPs back into the fold, secure the support from members of the hardline Brexiteer European Research Group, and keep the 10 Democratic Unionist Party onside. Even with that, it's not quite enough; Johnson would need the support of a number of opposition Labour MPs.

If Johnson succeeded in overcoming all these apparently insurmountable obstacles, he would be lauded as the Prime Minister who succeeded, where two previous ones had failed. And if we know anything about Johnson, it's that he very much likes to be liked.

What about a no-deal?

If Johnson's Brexit proposals are rejected by the EU, legislation passed by lawmakers opposed to a no-deal exit would come into play. That law requires Johnson to write a letter to the EU requesting an extension to the Brexit process if a deal is not secured by October 19 -- after the crucial summit of European leaders.

But some have still floated the possibility that the government could simultaneously abide by the law, and leave without a deal on October 31. The details remain murky, but it seems to involve a situation whereby the government would somehow persuade the EU to reject the extension that it had asked for.

The idea that the Prime Minister would speak out of both sides of his mouth in this way seems extraordinary. But these are exceptional times.

If it became clear that the government was determined to flout the law and take the UK out of the EU without a deal, as many Brexiteers insist on, Johnson would likely find himself back in front of the courts

It's also hard to see that the opposition would not, at this stage, seek to bring down his government through a vote of no-confidence in Parliament.

Great to hear you're no longer running scared. The voters have a choice: getting Brexit done with me, or the pointless delay you're offering. Name the date. https://t.co/jY88u0Zrb6 — Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) October 5, 2019

However, the timing would be tight, and opposition lawmakers would need to have an alternative government ready to take over -- something that would require the support of rebel Conservative MPs. If Johnson lost a confidence vote, but the opposition couldn't win one, he would simply be able to run down the clock to no-deal.

Could Johnson be forced into a seeking an extension?

The anti-no-deal legislation -- which Johnson is fond of describing as the ""surrender bill"" -- is very tightly written. Not only does it require Johnson to seek a Brexit extension in the event of failing to agree a deal, but it also requires him to mean what he says -- that is, he cannot ""frustrate its purpose.""

As part of a case brought in a Scottish court on Friday , the UK government was obliged to set out how it would comply by that law. And Johnson appears to have given a very firm commitment that he would request the extension demanded by the legislation.

""The Prime Minister accepts in relation to the 2019 Act that... he will send a letter in the form set out in the schedule by no later than 19 October 2019,"" the government's written case says, according to Jolyon Maugham, the anti-Brexit lawyer whose Good Law Project is backing the case.

That firm promise appears to be at odds with the PM's assertion that he would rather be ""dead in a ditch"" than delay Brexit. However, there are some who believe that Johnson -- having exhausted every other avenue -- might execute the mother of all U-turns.

Second referendum?

Blaming a ""remainer"" Parliament and an ""establishment"" judiciary, Johnson could throw up his hands, request the extension and then head into what presumably would be an inevitable -- and divisive -- election campaign with a promise to finish the Brexit job if voters give him a big enough majority in Parliament.

This presupposes that the EU would agree to an extension request. ""In theory, there is a possibility that the EU might simply say no,"" Fowler said. ""But many Brussels watchers think that's unlikely, partly because the EU won't want to be seen to be ejecting a member state against its will.

""There's also the EU politically not wanting to be seen as blamed if a no-deal Brexit were to happen.""

EU leaders would also want to see some evidence that any delay would be used in a more productive way than what's been observed in the UK over the last six months. The possibility of a general election could be enough of a reason, given that it could trigger a major shift in the UK's position on Brexit -- not least because, if opposition parties won it, a second referendum would suddenly become a distinct possibility.

Whatever happens, it's clear that the next three weeks are among the most consequential yet for the Brexit process. And unlike the last deadline, it seems that some kind of path to a resolution of the apparently intractable issue will emerge.",Eliza Mackintosh,"play,25,european,deal,days,heres,uk,eu,day,extension,support,law,opposition,johnson,brexit",2019-10-06 00:00:00
"Nakhon Sawan (CNN) — A hilltop in central Thailand is attracting UFO seekers who believe extraterrestrials hover above a huge Buddha statue, send telepathic communiques, walk across nearby sugarcane fields and use a crocodile-infested lake as a portal from their planets -- Pluto and Loku.

Though it may sound like science fiction, a small group of individuals claims messages from aliens arriving in spaceships include plenty of traditional religious teachings too -- leading them to believe they are actually Buddhist.

It's all happening three hours by road or rail north from Bangkok in Nakhon Sawan -- which translates to ""City of Heaven.""

Without all the UFO hype , it's just a laid-back small town. But followers believe that if you meditate on Khao Kala hill, outside of Nakhon Sawan, you could hear the talkative silver creatures as voices in your head, speaking whatever language your thoughts usually chatter.

They do offer a disclaimer, saying there is no guarantee you will see UFOs or aliens, which are described as unpredictable, speaking or appearing spontaneously and disappearing after a few hours.

Government attempts to ban gatherings

The group's activities have gotten them into trouble with Thai authorities in recent weeks.

Government officials reportedly grew alarmed when UFO seekers began crowding onto Khao Kala hill to see and talk with aliens, possibly endangering the area's official ""protected forest area"" status.

Visitors are allowed to climb to the top of the hill and view the large Buddha statue and nearby ""Buddha footprint,"" which are places of public worship. But the law forbids anyone from living or staying overnight in such zones, including previous UFO seekers who pitched tents at the site.

In August, about 40 officials, including members of the Forestry Department, disbanded a group of Thai enthusiasts at the top of Khao Kala, and petitioned a court to ban mass gatherings there.

On September 20, about 30 police and forestry officials confronted Wassana Chuensamnaun, lead campaigner for the extraterrestrials, and about 60 other UFO enthusiasts.

The group, wearing white clothing, planned to have a video made while members ""meditated"" atop the hill after sunset in hopes of mind-melding with aliens, Wassana tells CNN Travel.

Not wanting to be arrested, the UFO followers regrouped at the bottom of the hill on private property, meditated for a few hours and departed, she says.

""When the UFO spun me, I didn't feel dizzy at all""

As for the origins of the hill's supposed attractiveness to extraterrestrials, believers say it all began in 1997, when retired Sergeant-Major Cherd Chuensamnaun, deep in Buddhist meditation at home, received mental messages from what he insisted were aliens.

He told his family. They scoffed.

""I asked my father to tell the aliens to show themselves,"" says Wassana, his daughter.

""The next day, the aliens sent energy to spin my brother and brother-in-law.""

She says the two men were yanked up from the living room sofa and spun simultaneously, like whirling dervishes, out of the house and into the yard.

""I felt like my legs and my arms had to spin,"" adds Wassana's brother-in-law Jaroen Raepeth.

""I could not control myself for four or five minutes. I didn't feel afraid. We both spun outside.""

Through an upstairs window, Wassana's sister-in-law says she saw a UFO.

""It was about 10 or 15 meters long, at treetop level,"" adds Wassana.

Asked to re-enact his spinning, Jaroen twirls slowly around the living room with his arms out, but soon falls down and stays on the floor, looking dazed.

""I feel dizzy. But when the UFO spun me, I didn't feel dizzy at all.""

Wassana, who quit her job as a nurse to champion the extraterrestrial, says her father continued to receive telepathic messages over the years.

""Before my father died [in 2000], he taught us how to communicate with the aliens,"" she adds.

Today, she says more than 100 other Thais have this ability after practicing with her. Followers post updates and photos at the family's-linked UFOKaoKala Facebook group and elsewhere, some insisting they too have seen aliens and spaceships in the area.

Silvery spaceships filled with silvery humanoids

Most alien encounters are reported near the family's home, on the outskirts of Nakhon Sawan at Khao Kala hill amid sugarcane fields and Bueng Boraphet Lake, which villagers warn is crocodile infested.

The aliens are described as slender, little, silvery humanoids.

Illustrations depict them standing upright on two legs with two arms and a bulbous bald head with a pointy face topped with a single antenna. Huge, glossy, almond-shaped black eyes gaze above a thin nose and miniature mouth.

Believers say silvery spaceships appear festooned with colorful lights or resemble the domed, circular, retro-UFOs seen in low-budget 1950s movies.

""There are two types of aliens,"" Wassana says. ""One group is from the planet Pluto. The others are from a planet named Loku.

""Pluto aliens are made of energy, can appear in physical form and are able to teach humans. Loku aliens have a physical body and knowledge of high technology. They work together.

""Pluto aliens worry about something so devastating happening on Earth, such as war or in the environment, that it might impact their planet. They also want to give some people the ability to communicate with them, so if humans destroy everything in a nuclear war, the aliens will be able to help survivors rebuild human civilization.""

The planet Loku ""is in the Milky Way, but they didn't tell us where.""

The aliens' purported choice of Khao Kala is unusual because it is the smallest among a cluster of loftier hills. Meditators say they are thankful they don't have to climb very high to reach the top.

Up there, a larger-than-life statue portrays Buddha protected by a mythical seven-headed ""naga"" snake, which has topped the hill for many years and was not associated with any UFOs before the family's tales.

A 360-degree view from the hill includes flat sugarcane fields below, where Wassana and other believers say they have seen aliens disembark a UFO, walk around and then vanish in an atomized puff.

""I've lived 10,000 years,"" Pluto's alien leader revealed in communiqués purportedly channeled through Wassana during 1998 and 1999.

""How long does it take for me to travel from Pluto to here? I travel through dimensions. It's advanced physics. I travel with my mind.""

'Embrace the cosmic laws'

Wassana says Pluto's alien leader also told her that Buddha was ""the greatest human mind,"" and ""never spoke to humans about paying attention to extraterrestrials, or about trying to communicate with them,"" but did tell followers ""to embrace the cosmic laws.""

Mind-melding communiqués from Pluto to Wassana include lots of advice about ""karma,"" ""reincarnation,"" ""greed,"" ""fear"" and other Buddhist concerns, she says, as well as the altruistic thought-bubble that you shouldn't worry about Earth's Apocalypse from nuclear war, climate change, mutant diseases or other ""catastrophes.""

Technologically superior, benevolent aliens promise to take care of selected ""survivors.""

That's good news in this Southeast Asian country where 95% of the population is Buddhist.

It may also give followers legal and social protection if their UFO group gets too popular. Thai authorities and society frown on anything they perceive as a cult that veers too far from traditional religious beliefs and becomes influential.

Buddhism is open to the possibility of extraterrestrials, ghosts, spirits and other non-human life, but warns against being sucked into an invisible cul-de-sac of absurd illusions.

When asked about Thais seeing UFOs and communicating with aliens, Buddhist scholar Veeranut Rojanaprapa, who has a PhD in philosophy and religion from St. John's University in Bangkok, tells CNN Travel: ""We don't need to know if it is real or not, if it's a fake story or it's reality. Buddha taught us that maybe the one who says that he thinks he can directly speak with the alien, or he believes, he hears them.

""But it is not useful. It doesn't matter if he hears the alien or not. It does not help us for [experiencing] nirvana,"" says Veeranut. ""We do not say if it is right or wrong if the human can speak to the alien. But please listen carefully: most of the situations are only illusion.""

Nevertheless, Bangkok-based Ploy Buranasiri has been visiting Khao Kala for nine years and says she's seen aliens and UFOs there several times.

Asked what she would like to say to the aliens, says: ""I would like ask for a relocation to their planet.""

"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump lashed out at Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah Saturday after Romney rebuked him for calling on Ukraine and China to investigate the family of former Vice President Joe Biden.

In a crude attack against a sitting senator from his own party, Trump tweeted, ""Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous 'ass' who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn't give it to him). He is so bad for R's!""

Trump's attack comes as he faces a widening impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives. Most congressional Republicans have remained silent and declined to speak out in opposition to the President's comments on Thursday that he wants both Ukraine and China to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. But Romney criticized the President in a statement Friday, saying, ""By all appearances, the President's brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.""

There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.

Romney also said, ""When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated."" CNN has reached out to Romney's office for response to the President's tweet.
